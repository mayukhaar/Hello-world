This is my "hello-world" repository. I have one image file in the master branch. 
I created a README.md file before deleting it and adding a README.html file later. 
I created another branch (hello-world1) where I added another image file. After that, I merged the this branch into the master branch. 
I repeated the process when I created another branch (hello-world2), added a new image file, and merged the branch into the master branch.
